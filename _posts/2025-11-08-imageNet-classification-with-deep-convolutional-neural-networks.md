### 🧩 Why I Chose This Paper
I wanted to begin my deep learning journey with a foundational paper—one that builds intuition without overwhelming technical jargon. This paper proved to be the perfect starting point. As one of the most influential works in **computer vision** history, it fundamentally reshaped how we approach large-scale image classification by demonstrating the transformative power of **convolutional neural networks**.

### Terminology I learned
* **ImageNet** - a large visual database for visual object recognition. Containing more than 14 million hand-annotated images and 20,000 + categories [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet).
* **ILSVRC** (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) - an annual computer vision competition where algorithms compete to accurately classify and detect objects and scenes across millions of images [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet).
* **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** - an advanced version of ANNs, to extract features from grid-like matrix datasets [[2]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/introduction-convolution-neural-network/)
* **Non-Saturating neuron** - an activation function that doesn't "flatten out" or become nearly zero in its gradient, even for large input values.

* - Saturating Neurons - sigmoid, tanh
* - Non-saturating neurons - ReLU

* Dropout - a regularization technique, for preventing overfitting, which randomly ignores or drops out some layer outputs during training.
